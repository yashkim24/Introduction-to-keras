# Requirements
This tutorial requires the following packages:

* Python version 3.5

* Python 3.4 should be fine as well
likely Python 2.7 would be also fine, but who knows? :P
* numpy version 1.10 or later: http://www.numpy.org/

* scipy version 0.16 or later: http://www.scipy.org/

* matplotlib version 1.4 or later: http://matplotlib.org/

* keras version 2.0 or later: http://keras.io

* tensorflow version 1.0 or later: https://www.tensorflow.org

* ipython/jupyter version 4.0 or later, with notebook support

(Optional but recommended):

* pyyaml
* hdf5 and h5py (required if you use model saving/loading functions in keras)
*NVIDIA cuDNN if you have NVIDIA GPUs on your machines. https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download
The easiest way to get (most) these is to use an all-in-one installer such as Anaconda from Continuum. These are available for multiple architectures.
